				<h2>Archie Andrews</h2>

				<p> Likes: Girls, milkshakes, girls, sports, girls, going to the beach (to see more girls!)

					Dislikes: Homework, shoveling snow, Reggie’s pranks

					Originally known as “America’s Typical Teenager,” Archie Andrews has become the most lovable kid in town and is anything but typical! His signature cross cut red hair and freckles paint the perfect portrait of Archie’s klutzy-but-kind nature. He is always willing to help out friends and hopes to lead his band The Archies to the top of the charts! While not a straight-A student what Arch lacks in academic ability, he makes up for in the romance department—namely his relationships with Betty and Veronica! The best friends tend to fight over the redheaded Romeo… although Archie is notorious for keeping both in a never-ending love triangle! He has also been attached to several other females in Riverdale. He is not just a teenage Casanova though–Archie has a reputation of being selfless, loyal and someone who is eager to lend a hand anytime.

				<h2>Veronica Lodge</h2>

				<p> Likes: Fashion, shopping, being the center of attention

					Dislikes: Slobs, being ignored, having her credit cards deactivated
					
					Known as Riverdale’s privileged princess, Veronica Lodge is the richest gal in town. She tends to focus on the finer things in life and has no issue waving her money around for the world to see! “Ronnie” also has a habit of using her wealth to snag Archie away from her best friend Betty at every turn! The three always find themselves in a crazy love triangle—one that has no end in sight! As the heiress to Lodge Industries, her bottomless wallet allows Veronica to be the ultimate fashionista. This leads to the hottest fashions in town! She wants the best money can buy… even if Archie’s pockets are filled with lint! Despite her expensive taste, Ronnie’s heart is second only to the size of her mansion.

				<h2>Betty Cooper</h2>

				<p> Likes: Reading, writing, community service, Archie!

					Dislikes: Arguments, injustice, being 2nd best

					Confident and caring, Elizabeth “Betty” Cooper is the classic girl-next-door. The blonde bombshell was the original center of attention for Archie’s affections. Her sweet nature makes her one of the friendliest gals around—until her best friend Veronica comes to steal Archie away! The two somehow maintain their close friendship despite this ongoing rivalry. Betty is an avid writer who never goes a day without filling her diary with thoughts and stories. Her entries usually focus on a day in Riverdale High, but occasionally these tales can become fantastical sagas starring her fellow students! She hopes to one day showcase her work and become a famous author. Betty’s kindhearted ways have endeared her to everyone, and her bright mind will lead to a bright future.

				<h2>Jughead Jones</h2>

				<p> Likes: Burgers, fries, ham, chicken, pizza, sausage, noodles, eggs, cheese and everything else on your grocery list!

					Dislikes: Work, dating, hunger
					
					Always hungry and fiercely lazy, Forsythe P. “Jughead” Jones III is best recognized by his insatiable appetite and interesting choice of headwear. Archie’s best pal has a tendency to eat superhuman amounts of food in a single sitting, and never gains a pound! He seems to have a sixth sense when it comes to chow—he can tell when it is near and devours all of it soon after! Unlike his starry-eyed best friend, Jughead is much more analytical about a lot of things. Considering how much trouble it gets Archie in, Jug is a little wary of dating! The unique hat Jughead wears is actually a good luck charm that he never takes off. Bad things tend to happen when the cap is removed, such as his female foil Ethel stealing a kiss! Jug is also surprisingly sharp and witty compared to his casual demeanor. He prefers to march to his own beat, and his genius usually goes unacknowledged.
